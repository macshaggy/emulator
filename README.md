# GamePyBoy

## Description
This is another GameBoy emulator written in python. The project is from the website [Inspired Python](https://www.inspiredpython.com/). The article is ["Let's Write a Game Boy Emulator in Python"](https://www.inspiredpython.com/course/game-boy-emulator/let-s-write-a-game-boy-emulator-in-python).


## Why?
The series is just as stated, it's just inspiration with just enough research links to get a person started. My goals for this project are to learn more python and to have a working GameBoy emulator. I will be tracking

## Some things
I'm using poetry as my dependency tracker for the moment. And the project is written in 3.10 so to use the latest features of this version of python.

## Testing
Testing is using [hypothesis](https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis/) so that is another learning curve on testing. I could do simpler testing using pytest but the website gives just enough information so as I figured I'd incorporate hypothesis into my project.

## Documenting
I will start documenting things both in code, logging stumbling blocks, and why I did what I did, so that, this repo could be used to teach or help point others in the opposite direction. I may start a website on my personal domain but I'll wait on that one.
